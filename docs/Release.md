The process of releasing and things that need to be checked before.

### 1. Code
  * Fix crashes and critical bugs
  * Be sure the code works and there is nothing that would make it broken
  * Make sure all tools or debug logs in code are disabled
  * _Try a clean rebuild and check `make install`?_

### 2. Update
  * Content
    * For new **tracks**:
      - make [tracks ghosts](Editor.md#steps-after),  
      - add to [ini](../config/tracks.ini), [champs](../config/championships.xml) and [challs](../config/challenges.xml) xml files (all in config/)  
      - run `stuntrally3 check`  
      - update tracks `_previews`, run `tracks/previews.py`  
    * Run editor **tools** to check tracks  
      (errors, presets, etc.: ToolSceneXml, ToolTracksWarnings)  
      by starting with arguments:  
      `sr-editor3 scene` and `sr-editor3 warnings`
    * For new **vehicles**:
      - check hood, in-car cameras, boost and flare pos
      - perf tests, easy sim, etc  
      - either add to champs and challs or make new ones for them
  * [Readme.md](../Readme.md) - links, track count, etc
  * Version numbers
    * in Gui, file [*_en.tag.xml](../data/gui/core_language_en_tag.xml), tag `name="GameVersion"`
    * in [dist/installer.iss](../dist/installer.iss) script, SR_Version at top
  * [Sync translations](Localization.md#translation-sync)  
    check some other language so there are no `#{MyGUI Tags}` in GUI

### 3. Test
  * Check all the game modes:  
    Championship, Challenge, Collection,  
    **Split screen, Multiplayer, Replays**
  * Check at least new features and important older ones (from [Features](Features.md))
  * Delete/rename your user dir to check default config (update *-default.cfg)
  * Try a few different Vehicles and Tracks
  * Test Graphics presets from combo
  * Try **Track Editor** - duplicate a track, save,  
    and at least basic editing, of each mode

### 4. Packages
  * Create packages for supported systems and test them
    * Windows installer - use [dist/installer.iss](../dist/installer.iss) (more info on top of file) with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php),  
     _could be easy if from CI builds from github Actions?_
    * Linux binaries - need VM (was 20.04), _old_ info how to [here](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally/tree/master/dist/linux-archive)
  * _Make sure all packages use the same version of the sources (meh)_
  * Once the packages work _(or before)_, **git tag** the version number to all repositories (stuntrally3 and tracks3)
  * Upload packages (used rsync to sourceforge)
  * download back and test _(or check checksums)_

### 5. Websites
  * Update websites
    * [Homepage](https://cryham.org/stuntrally/), tracks count, [Downloads](https://cryham.org/stuntrally/downloads/) release date, links
    * docs/ [Changelog](Changelog.md), [Features](Features.md), [Statistics](Statistics.md)
  * Update Tracks Browser
    * rename [tracks.ini](../config/tracks.ini) to .txt, use [make_roadstats_xml.py](../dist/make_roadstats_xml.py), copy into CMS
    * also cars.xml for Car Browser, remove unnecessary comments
  * For significant look changes update:  
    home **screens** gallery, *and pics on other websites*, [ogre-next Readme](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre-next?tab=readme-ov-file)
  * _Notify known third-party packagers about new release_
  * Announce release - on [New Forum](https://groups.f-hub.org/stunt-rally/),  
   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stuntrally/), [Ogre showcase](https://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=58244), meh old: [VDrift dev](https://vdrift.net/Forum/showthread.php?tid=1629), [freegamer](https://freegamer.blogspot.com/), etc.
