- **Bugs** and notable **missing** features from SR 2.8, not yet present in SR 3.0:
  - broken multiplayer on Windows
  - Video options: Resolution, Vsync, Antialiasing, etc are not on Gui, but in Ogre dialog before start. No Limit Fps
    - Can't change them without quit. Also possibly alt-tab could require track reload on Windows.
  - Terrain shadowmap, Fluids: depth color, Refraction, smooth border. Grass deform, Trees wind.
  - HUD: minimap terrain or border, bad other position markers, bad in splitscreen: gauges, minimaps, digits etc
  - Editor
    - Slower road editing (~20 Fps not 60), added skip. Full Rebuild (B) takes quite _long_, columns need it
    - Bad reflection in editor F7 camera, less Fps (minimap RTTs don't skip, no terrain+road mode)
    - Object pick errors,  moved Terrains bad edit cursor pos
  - On older PCs: slower track loading (e.g. 5 sec not 1) and few lags due to long shaders compilation etc
  - Generally lighting changed due to sRGB colors (also using gamma to fix 1.15)
    - Every color in e.g. sun, particles, materials etc needs adjusting when converting from SR 2.x (make it darker, more saturated)
  - Grass not lit by vehicle lights, particles are unlit
