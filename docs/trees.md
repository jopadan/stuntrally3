## 🌳Trees to do

A copy from old forum. To I could edit, mark here etc.

Trees are in SR3 just like other objects. Just export and put mesh and textures in trees2/,  
add in presets.xml, new material in all.material.json (copy similar) and test in editor.

They need **LODs** (like 3 at least, let's say up to 6). This is *very* important.  
LODs are done with that OgreMeshTool or could even be set (and work) in export from Blender.  
If we had a tree with 30k tris it needs to reduce it very quickly. Less issue for 10k trees but still needs. And for a 3k tree that's already too low so whatever.  

LODs need testing and this is tedious.  
Testing is done with 1st slider on Gui tab Detail to 0 (lowest lod bias).  
They can't look bad (too separated tris, lost shape, etc). If they do then total % tris reduced is too high.  
But with good (e.g. 20k) trees LODs need to allow us to have many of them far without too high triangles count (F11 to test).

## Tree Generators

So firstly there is a great tool, (better than what I used to generate trees2/) new trees generator:  
https://drajmarsh.bitbucket.io/tree3d.html  
good but not complex, probably needs just textures from elsewhere.  
See my comment *below*, I actually go with Blender addon `Sapling Tree Gen` now, has much more options.

## Collection

Below I have a huge list of links
- We need for jungle first, this could be hard not many good models, low poly.
- Palms also, many available. Few bushes even too.
- Some other too, could be easy

So let's try first those with good tris count, 5-10k (could go up to 20-30k with great LODs).  
Other way you could just use those links for leaves textures and do it with that generator above.  

Be extra *cautious*: check for licenses and real artists. Avoid trolls or bots copying stuff around idiotically, there are some on sketchfab.

Ok so far I did test a few new trees I made in the new [web generator](https://drajmarsh.bitbucket.io/tree3d.html).

So ugh SR3 doesn't really handle HQ trees well. I thought we could have 20k or 30k tris but seriously (for jungle) it's better to not go over 8k, unless for very rare trees. As soon as a tree is often, dense this rises total triangles rendered very much.

So yeah I'm gonna aim at 7k or so for normal, big trees, and like 4k for medium etc. And I'm already using just square (4) for branches max hexagonal (6) steps. Broad trunk will need manual refines (in Blender) near bottom for good look.

Another important thing are LODs. Well so far I got them only meh looking. But needed. IDK if possible or how to conveniently generate meshes separately and join them into 1 mesh LODs. Would likely give better results. Right now the auto generation just drops leaves (too much) and they quickly look like stick figures, like half of what the trees were.

So yeah trees are pretty delicate and crucial for Fps and render performance.

I'll continue with this. Will be doing jungle first, tree.07, tree.09 will drop first. I'll do few different trees to replace varying on sceneries (probably own for jungle, forest, savannah etc).

- CryHam · 26 Jan 2024

Well, web tree generator is okay but doesn't have that many options. But is surely the fastest way of making simple trees, well still need to import obj in Blender scale etc and export.

I found like 3 **addons for Blender**.

1. Sapling Tree Gen, it is already in Blender, need to just enable. Works fine and has plenty options.  
[Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMDRc4hJwvA) and [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTtqdRAM_00). Only thing is that you can't change parameters after creating, they're gone. And needs some extra material setup to actually see textures in Blender before.
There is also an [Improved version](https://blenderartists.org/t/improved-sapling-tree-generator/642704), I'm not sure yet.
2. MTree [modular-tree-addon](https://blender-addons.org/modular-tree-addon/) (newer code [here](https://github.com/steven-ray/modular_tree)) has blocks and should fix above, but IDK I don't see all stuff from [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQx0eh8z-iM), and can't get simple square leaves.
3. [Tree-gen](https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn_0I1cKaZE). I didn't like it, I don't see many options.

I've also gathered some jungle tree examples to know what I want to do in jungle and some general jungle knowledge.  
Nice [diagrams here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=rainforest+layers+height+range&t=ftsa&atb=v395-1&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images) (e.g. [this one](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-06hGv0ip5kA/V_-5LfiIwHI/AAAAAAAA4yY/nMD0A1KJpgMgzsCpMZb_ENALL5UhNl_ugCHM/s1600/emergent-layer-brazil-nut-tree-ref-tropical-rainforest.jpg)). Wow trees are huge in jungle: like up to 50m high for the biggest rare, main normal are up to 30m and those small palms and other are 15m. Heh, I can't even, it'll be a challenge doing all this it in SR3, as we ain't got even 1/3 of that and already my GPU touches limits. But I did recently reduce that [1.6M tris huge](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ceiba-pentandra-tree-9142b8f06e384f1c9554c9b10da79d2a) tree, to just 7k for trunk, will need more for leaves, but seems doable.

I also asked about manual LOD meshes. I find that auto LOD generator getting in the way. It always looses leaves first, makes them empty, etc. Meh I think even if more work it'd better to do LODs manualy, probably not possible. Either way it's done so in paid models.

- CryHam · 27 Jan 2024

Lol, looks like toilet paper. Anyway too high tris count.

I added more info about meshes. Also shows all materials and LODs now.

For Objects and Vegetation. Good info, since I don't remember what I used where.
😆

- CryHam · 9 Feb 2024

Okay I'll be using [improved-sapling-tree-generator](https://github.com/abpy/improved-sapling-tree-generator) from sapling_4 branch.

I'm quite happy with the features.

I'll save settings for each tree and .blend files for future, when I get any new trees.

I did only 1 tree, not finished yet.

Also it's a Blender add-on, where we need to export from so it's faster.

- CryHam · 15 Jun 2024

Okay finally some progress with jungle trees, just from ready models. IDK yet if it's too many triangles still for big tracks. But these look awesome. 3 new trees here now, triangles from 15k to 22k each, and 3 to 6 materials for each. Also I got refraction and depth color for waters but needs some work still.
😍

- Kris · 16 Jun 2024

Indeed that looks excellent. Pretty similar to SpeedTree I think.

- CryHam · 16 Jun 2024

Well this is something. The only problem is it's gonna need some decent optimizing to get it working for big tracks. It's a small track here.

- CryHam · 17 Jun 2024

Added some new old bushes. Feels amazing. But now it already drops below 60 Fps on this map.
I think this will be present on Tiny or Muddy and such small tracks.
😍

- Kris · 18 Jun 2024

Automatic billboard creation for distant trees like Unreal Engine does it? Not easy to do though with the correct lighting and all, I guess.

- CryHam · 18 Jun 2024

Yeah billboards for far trees would be cool, also for trees on horizons. We don't have them now, we had those in SR 2.x called impostors.
But my problem now is not even that. I need to get really good LOD meshes for each tree, manually made. Or just drop tree triangles even lower. They look still detailed.
Right now I got auto LODs for trees which still give like half of total triangles further (so e.g. will drop from 30 milion to 15) but look really ugly, since they just simply drop triangles, and look sparse. It's surely a challenge.

- CryHam · 2 Jul 2024

I'm adding many bushes, there are lots of models available. Should make forests better too.
Maybe even some will fit deserts.
👍

- CryHam · 9 Jul 2024

I got 3 new palms so far. Quite cool. They make a big difference. Our meshes got very old. Few bushes also fit deserts.
😍

- CryHam · 6 Aug 2024

I added bushes also to Forest and Mud sceneries.
We have now 6 new palms total. Present on Deserts, Island, Greece tracks.
I am currently dealing with Savannah trees etc. Replacing oldest meshes btw.
👏

- poVoq · 6 Aug 2024

Have you considered also changing the track texture and adding some track specific smaller plants? I think the last screenshot shows quite well how the track texture blends a bit too unrealistically with the green terrain texture.

I guess the original intention was to make it look like there is some vegetation on the track, but that isn't really how those tracks look in reality. They rather expose the soils below entirely, or are even covered with gravel manually placed there. There might still be some plants growing on the track here and there, but those look rather different to the near uniform green that currently blends through the track texture.

- CryHam · 7 Aug 2024

You mean road texture? Yes I don't really like it either. Also very old. I have some new textures in mind with gravel etc. Will need to replace someday. Lot of work of course.
I haven't even touched our ancient old mushrooms. I found many new, and want to replace on outer space sceneries. I think I'll do this earlier. OFC new jungle trees are priority, and replacing oldest meshes for complete CC list. Then maybe sounds, ugh.
👍

- CryHam · 11 Aug 2024

Allright.
Today is a celebration 🎉.
I've replaced all oldest trees and palms on all tracks.
The only left to do are shrooms big and small, and maybe old firs too.
The difference is huge in Jungle.
Also notable on Forest (got own new trees too), Islands, Moss, etc.
Jungle is a new thing now. I can't stop driving to look at new vegetation 😲.
You can see screens in our Tracks browser starting [from here](https://cryham.org/stuntrally/tracks?id=Jng1-Curly).
But this is great for high end GPUs. Lower will need reducing options as always.
🎉

- CryHam · 14 Aug 2024

Okay I did shrooms🍄. Lol, I mean I replaced oldest low poly, small texture mushrooms.
Changes can be seen on Aln, Uni tracks in our browser. E.g. [Aln here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/tracks3?id=Aln3-MushroomBeach), [or here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/tracks3?id=Aln1-AlienBase), [Uni here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/tracks3?id=Uni3-Cloud), [and here](https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/tracks3?id=Uni2-Swirl) etc.
