## Help

Topic gathering all help pages, info, etc.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è SR3 Info, Help, Links, About, etc.

üéâ Welcome to the new Stunt Rally 3 Forum.

Old forum with over 1000 posts, is now read only archive.
üì®How to post here?

This forum is invitation only. In order to post or vote in polls etc. you'd need to:

- üìßEmail cryham, info is on his About me page. I'm not putting my email plainly to avoid spam.
- Put a few words into it, if you have any other profiles, etc. So I could verify you're a human.
- I then reply with a secret link that will allow creating a new user here.

Once here on forum, I recommend starting threads, maybe doing polls, etc. If you have: an idea, a new track, data/content rework plan, each could be in own thread. If you plan doing something, also worth own topic to discuss etc.
üìöDocumentation, Help

Before asking for Help, you should be familiar with our [Documentation](_menu.md), as many things are described already there.  
Some helpful pages are:
- [FAQ](), [Running](), [Troubleshooting](), [Multiplayer]()
- [Track Editor](), [Objects](), [Materials]()

## ü™≤Reporting bugs

Because of the email etc. needed for new users, it may be easier to post bugs and issues on github: new Issue here.

When reporting a Bug (like a crash or problem in game or editor) it's best to (so it'd be most useful):

    Tell which system you have, and which game version

    Include logs, see here how to find them: Paths

    attach them in post, preferably all (ogre.log is crucial or ogre_ed.log for editor)

    Provide us with info on what happened as much as possible

    If you can replicate it, write how to do it

    Be sure that you meet the minimal hardware requirements

    Read the section What we will ask from you and best answer those questions already in post

    If you already have and know how to report bugs well, you may not need to do all above.

ü§ùContributing

Help is welcome, this is best described in Contributing page.

I made sticky posts / threads about tracks and vehicles on this forum as before.
üöÄProgress, Features

List of done SR 3.x features is in SR3 Features and old SR 2.x features here.

Now some useful links for tracking progress and new things added to SR3.

    What is already done (new), and will be released in next version is on top of SR3 Changelog.

    Before submitting an idea or feature you should look at Tasks ToDo. And possibly other posts here. It's very likely that it is already planned (or was discussed and won't be).

    Tasks ToDo list needs sorting by P (priority) first, where 1 is the highest. It also shows what I'm planing to do or doing, with more description.

    The Roadmap page lists what is planned to be in next releases (mostly code). It is updated frequently, but has items with less info. I'm mostly alone developing the game (code), and I have my vision of it, so I'm developing according to my plans.

    Roadmap may have a few short points about data / content, but Forum has much more.

    Lastly (or firstly), for the freshest updates you can check latest commits in git: stuntrally3 and tracks3. Could also star or watch on github. Granted, these commits don't have much text info, since I use shortcuts everywhere, to avoid typing and health issues from it. But commits always tell more inside, what changed in which files etc. I do use some emoji‚ú® in message for commits that did more than the rest (or added new thing).

I have been thinking about opening up email registrations here. Given the relative obscurity of Loomio, I doubt we would be seeing much spam bots and you can still have individual communities as invite/read-only.

Another option would be to open up registrations on the main git forge (I am thinking of moving away from LDAP there, which made this difficult so far).

@CryHam any thoughts on the matter? I saw you opened a Github discussions page, so I guess you would also prefer to have it more open?

I don't know, I'm opening some other popular ways too (for users to communicate or post about SR). I see nobody posts there anyway. I guess maybe that discord took over all.
But I think the main reason is still simple: there aren't people who want to post or contribute. Likely because SR is still not popular. I'm judging it's about 10x less than it was at its peak.
I can hardly imagine anyone new wanting to post here, giving up after seeing they need to email me then getting a link for access. It's not that complicated, as compared to any other forum or platform.
So yeah I'm ok if it stays as it is, or any ways you add, if that doesn't bring any spam OFC.
I still would rather keep this as contributors forum and for others who can comment on features etc. Not full of random people also talking random stuff unrelated to SR. Perhaps there should be a SR discord too, e.g. for that.

I enabled that people can create an account here on this Loomio instance without an invitation. It is possible to switch the groups settings here to require an join application if you prefer people to not start posting freely without your approval.

If you want a promotional fediverse account for Stunt Rally, I have our GoToSocial instance running now: https://social.f-hub.org/ It basically is a minimal ActivityPub server with a highly customizable public profile page.

To register an account you need to first sigh up on the main Forgejo instance on f-hub.org and then you can use that account to sign in on the other services including the above and also this forum.
