## Help

Topic gathering all help pages, info, etc.

‚ÑπÔ∏è SR3 Info, Help, Links, About, etc.

## üìöDocumentation, Help

Before asking for Help, you should be familiar with our [Documentation](_menu.md), as many things are described already there.  
Some helpful pages are:
- [FAQ](Faq.md), [Running](Running.md), [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md), [Multiplayer](Multiplayer.md)
- [Track Editor](Editor.md), [Objects](Objects.md), [Materials](Materials.md)

## ü™≤Reporting bugs

It may be easier to post bugs and issues on github: [new Issue here](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally3/issues).

When reporting a Bug (like a crash or problem in game or editor) it's best to (so it'd be most useful):

- Tell which system you have, and which game version
- Include logs, see here how to find them: [Paths](Paths.md)
- attach them in post, preferably all (ogre.log is crucial or ogre_ed.log for editor)
- Provide us with info on what happened as much as possible
- If you can replicate it, write how to do it
- Be sure that you meet the minimal [hardware requirements](Running.md#hardware-requirements)
- Read the section [What we will ask from you](Troubleshooting.md#what-we-will-ask-from-you) and best answer those questions already in post
- If you already have and know how to report bugs well, you may not need to do all above.

## ü§ùContributing

Help is welcome, this is best described in [Contributing](Contributing.md) page.

I made sticky posts / threads about tracks and vehicles on this forum as before.

## üöÄProgress, Features

List of done SR 3.x features is in [SR3 Features](Features.md) and old SR 2.x [features there](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally/blob/master/docs/features.md).

Useful <u>links</u> for tracking progress and new things added to SR3.

- Development has stopped. Project's [status](status.md) page. So there won't really be any progress.
- Firstly for the freshest updates you can check latest commits in git: [stuntrally3](https://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally3/commits/main) and [tracks3](https://github.com/stuntrally/tracks3/commits/main).  
Could also star or watch on github. Granted, these commits don't have much text info, since I use [shortcuts](../src/emojis.txt) everywhere, to avoid typing and health issues from it. But commits always tell more inside, what changed in which files etc. I do use some emoji‚ú® in message for commits that did more than the rest (or added new thing).
- What is already done (new), and will be released in next version is on top of SR3 [Changelog](Changelog.md).
- Before submitting an idea or feature you should look at [Tasks ToDo](Tasks.md). It's very likely that it is already planned (or was discussed and won't be).
- [Tasks ToDo](Tasks.md) table with priorities, component, progress %, etc. It has more *description* for bigger tasks.
- The [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) page lists what is planned to be in next releases (mostly code). It is updated frequently, but has items with less info. I'm mostly alone developing the game (code), and I have my vision of it, so I'm developing according to my plans.
- [Roadmap may have a few short points about data / content, but Forum has much more.
